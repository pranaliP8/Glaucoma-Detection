# Glaucoma-Detection
In the field of medical diagnostics, early detection of glaucoma held immense importance in preventing irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma, a progressive eye disease, often exhibited subtle symptoms that could easily go unnoticed until advanced stages. The integration of deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, offered a promising avenue for improving glaucoma detection accuracy and efficiency. 
Traditional diagnostic methods, predominantly reliant on subjective assessments and manual evaluation by ophthalmologists, suffered from inter-observer variability and the potential for oversight. To address these limitations, a deep learning model for glaucoma detection was proposed. 
This completed work focused on utilizing deep learning algorithms to accurately identify glaucoma from retinal images. By automating the analysis of these images, the project aimed to aid healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate diagnoses. The goal was to assist in the early identification of glaucoma cases, allowing for prompt intervention and appropriate treatment. 
Deep learning used advanced neural networks to understand complicated patterns in complex data, which was great for analyzing medical images. By training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on extensive datasets of retinal images, algorithms were taught to recognize small details that indicated glaucoma in patients. Subsequent testing of the model on real-world patient data underscored its potential clinical integration, promising a transformative impact on glaucoma diagnosis.
